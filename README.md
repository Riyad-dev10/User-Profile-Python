# User Profile & Birth Year Calculator 🚀

This is my first Python project developed on Android using **Pydroid 3**. The application manages user profile data and accurately calculates the birth year.

## 🛠️ Features
- **Dynamic Calculation:** Uses the `datetime` library to ensure accurate age processing.
- **Input Validation:** Implements `try-except` blocks to handle non-numeric inputs and prevent crashes.
- **Formated Output:** Utilizes `f-strings` and string methods like `capitalize()` for a clean user interface.

## 📂 Project Structure
- `main.py`: The core Python logic and user interaction script.
- `Screenshot.png`: A visual demonstration of the program's output.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open the code in **Pydroid 3** or any Python environment.
2. Run the script and follow the on-screen prompts.
